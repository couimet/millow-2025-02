# Real Estate NFT DApp - Step-by-Step (2025-02)

This project is a step-by-step modernization of [`millow`](https://github.com/dappuniversity/millow), a decentralized real estate marketplace DApp created in October 2022. The goal is to update dependencies, improve the codebase, and adopt best practices with the latest Ethereum development tools.

Built on top of my [`step_by_step_progress`](https://github.com/couimet/millow/tree/step_by_step_progress#readme) project, this version introduces several improvements to ensure compatibility with modern Ethereum development tools.

## Key Updates in This Project

### Dependencies & Compatibility
- Updated dependencies to the latest versions and removed unused ones
- Upgraded `Solidity` to version `0.8.28`
- Refactored code to work with the latest Ethereum development tools

### Testing & Deployment
- Updated unit tests to use Hardhat's fixtures instead of `beforeEach()` blocks
- Refactored the Hardhat deployment script to use [Ignition Modules](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview)

### Miscellaneous Improvements
- Various minor enhancements for readability, maintainability, and performance

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contracts & Tests)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (Development Framework)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) (Blockchain Interaction)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)

## Requirements For Initial Setup
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) using [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://nvm.sh):
  `$ nvm use || nvm install`

## Setting Up
### 1. Clone/Download the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies:

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** To ensure you're using the correct Node.js version for this project, run "`nvm use || nvm install`" before installing dependencies.

`$ npm install`

### 3. Run tests
`$ npx hardhat test`

### 4. Start Hardhat node
`$ npx hardhat node`

### 5. Run deployment script
In a separate terminal execute:
`$ npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`

### 7. Start frontend
`$ npm run start`

## Running a Full Demo

This demo uses a Hardhat deployment script that initializes 4 predefined accounts:

- **`buyer`**: Account with index 0 in Hardhat  
- **`seller`**: Account with index 1 in Hardhat  
- **`inspector`**: Account with index 2 in Hardhat  
- **`lender`**: Account with index 3 in Hardhat  

### Prerequisites

1. Map the above accounts to your **Metamask wallet**:
   - Import the private keys for these accounts into Metamask if you haven't already.

### Steps to Complete a Property Purchase

1. **Open the Demo App**: Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.  
1. **Connect Metamask**: Connect your wallet to the app.  
   - The currently active account in Metamask doesn't matter during this step.  
1. **Select a Property**: Click on a property to view its details.  
1. **Perform Actions with the Specified Accounts**:
   - **Inspector**:  
     - Switch to the `inspector` account in Metamask.  
     - Click `Approve Inspection` and confirm the transaction in Metamask.  
   - **Lender**:  
     - Switch to the `lender` account in Metamask.  
     - Click `Approve and Lend` and confirm the transaction in Metamask.  
   - **Buyer**:  
     - Switch to the `buyer` account in Metamask.  
     - Click `Buy` and confirm the transaction in Metamask.  
   - **Seller**:  
     - Switch to the `seller` account in Metamask.  
     - Click `Approve & Sell` and confirm the transaction in Metamask.

### Expected Result

After completing the last step, the property details should display:  
**"Owned by 0xf39F...2266"**  

This indicates that the property is now owned by the `buyer` account (`0xf39F...2266`), which corresponds to index 0 in Hardhat.  

**Note**: Hardhat initializes account addresses in a predictable way when starting up, ensuring consistent behavior during each run.
